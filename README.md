# greek_gods_status_recognition_useing_siamese_networks

one of computer vision biggest challenges is recognizing, how you can recognize shapes, human faces, and objects how the computer can match the right images so I tried to dive into this task and apply deep learning technologies to recognize greek gods status so I used the famous siamese networks (SNNs) in this project I did this things :

1 - collecting greek gods images and building a dataset 

2 -created the data generators to use later for training 

3 - model architecture 

4 -triplet loss used to train this model 

5 - training with the hard loss mining approach 

I explained everything in the notebook hope you enjoy it
